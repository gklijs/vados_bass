## My journey to mastering the bass

This is the home page of my new site. I play bass about 5 years now, but trying to make an effort to improve my playing,
as I still consider myself a beginner. A lot of the time I didn't practice daily, something I try to improve with the
log starting in [February 2021](/log/2021/2).

In the past I used [Rocksmith 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocksmith_2014) to learn playing the bass. Sometimes
also with the sound via an amplifier, so I could better hear what I was doing. Most times in the near future I will
use [Scott's Bass Lessons](https://scottsbasslessons.com/) to practice. Right now I'm on 'Level 2' in the player path,
for completion I need to practice 3 songs by heart.
