## Amber Stars

I ordered Amber stars the first of April in 2020. I was delighted when I finally received it in February 2021.
The bass has a single Bartolini Soapbar Hambucker pickup in the p-bass position, and a 4-band Noll EQ.
It also has yellow leds, which are both cool, and should help a lot when playing at dark venues eventually.
