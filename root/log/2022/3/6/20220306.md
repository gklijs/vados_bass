## 6 - Bass Jump

Finally, took the time to watch the video from Scott.
Feel like I should have done that a lot earlier, lots of good tips for a beginner like me.
Was trying to keep up with Scott, but still hard to play it real time.
Feel like I might want to focus on one song at a time, rather than keep switching with limited time.
