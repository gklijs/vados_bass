##  Back to the Past

Did something I didn't do in a while, playing Rocksmith with my ['old' bass](/gear/TRBX304).

### Practicing some songs

Played a few songs, like Black Magic from the Magic Wands, and a few easy ones from Jow Division.
It was nice to play the old bass again, somehow it felt playing on the other one improved playing this one.
I even slightly improved my 'score' on American Idiot by Green Day.
