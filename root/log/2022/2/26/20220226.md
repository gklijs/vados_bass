##  Smooth Saturday

Playing the songs is now going well, next week I should also take timing into account.
I also tried some advanced piece, Muse's [Wont't stand down](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/muse/wont-stand-down-bass-4027705), as it is a 5-string song. Pretty complex trough, but with nice low notes. I'm hoping by the end of the year I might be able to play it.
