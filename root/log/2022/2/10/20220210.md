##  Practicing some notes

Yesterday I noticed a lot was going wrong, so I needed to take some steps back. One of the practice tracks yesterday, sledge hammer, had a lot of 1st and 3rd fret notes on both the E and the A string. So I tried just geting those notes right, and transition fast between them.
