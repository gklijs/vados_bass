##  SBL getting better at the three songs.

The three songs I'm practicing are September Leaves, Bass Jump and Sledge Hammer.

### Getting the notes in

Some songs are a lot easier than others, but I start to play them all ok. I sometimes have some fret buzz on the first fret. I'm only reading the bass tabs now, but kind of what to also be able to read the notes as well.
