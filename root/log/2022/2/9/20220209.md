##  First try with Amber Stars

Today was the first day I got to play on Amber Stars, my new Bogart bass. It needs some getting used to, especially since this is the first time I'm playing a 5 string. It sounds great and plays nicely. I also fired up SBL Academy after a long time. For the next steps I need to learn 3 relatively simple songs, trying to make that work with Amber Stars.
